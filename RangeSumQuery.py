# Range Sum Query - Immutable
'''
Question: Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
'''
# A brute force approach would be to loop through elements from i to j
# To speed up the calculation, we have take have to caching

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.dp = nums
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):

# Your NumArray object will be instantiated and called as such:
